# Detection of Gain Problem
Research concerning seismology and earthquake physics.

Project 1: Detecting potential gain problems in seismic arrays installed in South Korea. The method developed by Park and Ishii(2019) is              applied to perform such detection.

1-1. First, the test is conducted using the teleseismic events recorded by Hi-net stations which are the datasets used by Park and              Ishii(2019) to demonstrate applicability of their method.

1.2. If the method seems to reproduce the result shown by Park and Ishii(2019), the method is applied to seismograms recorded by seismic        arrays of South Korea.
